* Introduction
  This document is for automating the Virtual Labs cluster setup using
  ansible( Configuration management tool).
* Problem 
  The problem is [[https://bitbucket.org/vlead/systems-model/src/fd77adcc24ad68ce22194fad2224adb12c5219ab/src/bootstrapping.org?at%3Ddevelop&fileviewer%3Dfile-view-default][bootstrapping]] steps for cluster creation. For
  creating VLEAD cluster( Infrastructure for hosting labs),
  bootstrapping steps takes three to four days for VLEAD Employees( who
  knows about VLEAD cluster) and for others it may take two to three
  weeks.
* Objective 
  Automate the boostrapping steps and running [[https://bitbucket.org/vlead/systems-model/src/fd77adcc24ad?at%3Ddevelop][systems-model]] ansible
  playbooks. So that eliminate more number of days to setup VLEAD
  cluster and install cluster in minimal steps in one day.
* Requirements 
  - [[./req/index.org][Requirements]]
* Implementation
  - [[./imp/index.org][Implementation]]
* Installation manual
  - [[./imp/installation-steps.org][Installation manual]]
* Bootstrapping steps
  - [[./imp/bootstrapping.org][Bootstrapping steps]]
    These steps are needed to setup cluster using ansible scripts
    written in implementation section.
